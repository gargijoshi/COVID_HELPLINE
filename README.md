# COVID_HELPLINE
COVID Helpline Project in C++ | Classifies Zones | COVID Hospitals | Vaccination Centers

The Covid_Helpline project is made completely using C++. It contains 4 different modules: a. Zones: Classifies cities under different zones based on the patient count of particular city. b. Hospital: It lets you add, delete, view Covid Hospitals. It also enables you to check the bed count of hospitals in particular city. If patient gets admitted to any hospital, its bed count gets decreased. c. Testing: It helps people register for testing. It generates the report; and if the patient is positive, it asks the patient, if he/she wants to get admitted in the hospital or stay home quarantined. d. Vaccination: It lets people register themselves for vaccination. Children below 18 are not allowed for registration. It also displays the list of people registered for vaccination under particular city.
